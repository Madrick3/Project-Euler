# Project Euler
I've recently moved to Hackerrank and plan to use L33tCode for some time while I look for a job, so I wont be adding to this repo for some time.
Also at sometime, the .java files for some of my solutions disappeared in the repo and i dont actually know why, if you need them, I will commit them when i next work on Euler.
